EBBS Modules are an addon to EBBS 3.1.1, providing extra functionality to
the bbs system.  There are 7 modules in this initial release: 
Module Extras, Monitor, Stats, Query, Animation, PostWar, and Voting.

The 2 basic premises of the modules is to stay as much out of the standard
code as possible, and to be independent of each other.  The main reason
for this is to enable others to incorporate only the modules that they
want to either stock or modified EBBS code easily.

The modules add new functions to the builtin functions of EBBS.  None of
the stock functions are removed.  The new functions are enabled by entries
in the etc/menu.desc file.

This distribution should have been unpacked in your ebbs source directory.
Updates to this distribution will be found at ftp.nipha.com in the /pub
directory.

This readme file is incomplete.  Please read INSTALL.modules for
information on the modules.
