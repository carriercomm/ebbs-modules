Animation Tags:
--------------
[anim]
[noanim]
[bothanim]
[startanim]
[endanim]

    In order for a query screen to be recognized as animated,
    the first line _must_ be [anim] .  The [endanim] must be the _last_
    line in the animation.  All text after the [endanim] command is
    ignored.

Cursor Movement:
---------------
move(line,character)

    Move cursor to line and character in the animation area.  Queries are
    from 1,1 to 18,80.  

Pausing:
-------
msleep(delay)
sleep(delay)

    Pause for delay milliseconds (msleep) or seconds (sleep).  Maximum of
    10 seconds.

Erasing:
-------
erasea(line,startpos,endpos,delay)
eraseb(line,startpos,endpos,delay)

    Erase screen on line #, starting at startpos, ending at endpos, with
    delay. a for left-to-right, b for right-to-left.

Printing:
--------
print("text")
prints("text")
printa("text")
printb("text")
printclr("text")

    These print commands will print the text at the current cursor
    position.  The differences are where the cursor position is _after_
    the text is printed.  print doensn't move the cursor.  prints puts the
    cursor at the end of the text.  printa advances the cursor one
    position to the right.  printb backs up the cursor one position to the
    left.  Both printa and printb will wrap around the screen (a  -down,
    b - up).  printclr advances the cursor to the first character of the
    next line.  If the cursor is already on the last line, it will advance
    to the first line.

Random:
------
rprint(topline,topchar,botline,botchar,times,delay,"text")
rplace(topline,topchar,botline,botchar,times,delay,"text")

    Print text at random locations within the bounds of topline,topchar
    and botline,botchar.  Do it number of times with delay.  rprint leaves
    text on screen, rplace erases the previous text before printing the
    next one. 

random_display(delay)
...
text
...
end_random()

    Display block of text one character at a time with delay between
    characters until all text is displayed. 

Looping:
-------
loop(number)
...
other commands
...
endloop()

    Repeat the commands number times.  If number is 0, repeat until a key
    is pressed.

Clearing:
--------
clear()
    Clear the animation part of the screen.

clrtobot()
    Clear from the cursor position to the bottom of the screen.

clrtoeol()
    Clear from the cursor position to the end of the line.

Spelling:
--------
spella(line,startpos,delay,"text")
spellb(line,startpos,delay,"text")

    Spell out text from left-to-right (a) or right-to-left (b) on line#.
    First character of text starts at startpos.

Scrolling:
---------
scrolla(line,startpos,endpos,delay,"text")
scrollb(line,startpos,endpos,delay,"text")

wscrolla(line,startpos,endpos,winstart,winend,delay,"text")
wscrollb(line,startpos,endpos,winstart,winend,delay,"text")

    Scroll text on line #, 1st char of word starts at startpos, ends at
    endpos.  To scroll off screen use 0 (to scroll off left side) and 81
    (to scroll off right side). Remember to count the length of the text
    in calculating the character (starting for b, ending for f) for the
    right side of the screen).  Delay is in increments of 1/1000 of a
    second. a for left-to-right, b for right-to left.

linescra(line,delay,"text")
linescrb(line,delay,"text)

    Scroll text across entire line, scrolling on and off. a for
    left-to-right, b for right-to-left.
